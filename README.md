Data analysis has become one of the core processes in virtually any professional activity. The collection of data becomes easier and less expensive, so we have ample access to it.

The Julia language which was designed to address the typical challenges that data scientists face when using other tools. Julia, like Python, supports an efficient and convenient development process. At the same time, programs developed in Julia have performance comparable to C.

During this short course you will learn how to build data science models using Julia. Moreover, we will teach you how to deploy such model in production environments and scale the computations beyond a single computer.

This course does not require from the participants prior detailed knowledge of advanced machine learning algorithms not the Julia programming language. What we assume is basic knowledge data science tools (like Python or R) and techniques (like linear regression, basic statistics, plotting).
